/*
 *Guidelines:
 *
 * Extra credit: Due: Thursday April 4 (11:59 PM).
 * Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a line
 * of text. The function should work for both upper and lowercase characters.
 * For example,
 *           number = countOccurrences("aBC", "ABCdeaBcfgAbcd");
 * should assign 3 to number.
 * Write a main program to test your function.
 * To submit the extra credit, you must create a public repository on GitHub and tag me (@nasseef) when
 * you are done.
